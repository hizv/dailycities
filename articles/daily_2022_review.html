                            <p>Under the The Soft Pink Truth moniker, Drew Daniel has creatively subverted dance music
                                expectations by tackling very interesting and sometimes contradictory concepts. Each of
                                his LPs asks a question in it's namesake. For example, taking a super minimalistic
                                electroclash approach to Hardcore/Anarcho Punk staples on 2004's *Do You Want New Wave
                                or Do You Want The Soft Pink Truth*? (e.t. *Deeper Than This*?). On 2022's *Is It Going
                                to Get Any Deeper Than This?*, The Soft Pink Truth has come upon probably the most
                                interesting of these prompts. I love the story behind this question: it being directed
                                at Daniel and a friend from someone visiting their DJ set. The core idea of *Deeper Than
                                This?* is the of idea of trying to answer the question in a variety of musical forms,
                                all centered around *deepness*.</p>

                            <p>From beginning to end, this dwelling on deepness is the primary musical backdrop --
                                extremely pure and moody dance tracks through and through. It may seem like redundant
                                praise, but I do really enjoy how many aspects of this record tackle "deepness". There
                                is depth in the amount of styles "deepified", not just staying in the traditional Deep
                                House lane. Many styles are incorporated into the depths, embracing Dance music with
                                layered, intricate, and moody production. On "La Joie Devant La Mort" there is deep
                                French Pop set into an glamorous Nu-Disco track. "Sunwash" is probably the deepest of
                                the bunch, swirling synths and creeping production changes make for a hypnotic ambient
                                Deep House experience.</p>

                            <p>I could go into much more depth on this given a different written format, but at the end
                                of the day I think the most important question to answer is in the album title. I'd say
                                it does get deeper than *this*, however Dance music in general can only go so deep. In
                                fact I'd say the mission of this record was an amazing success. It's mission isn't to
                                prove how deep one could go, but is instead a creative retort to a strange question. The
                                layers of deepness, from the question itself to how the concept of deepeness is applied
                                to the music in many fascinating ways makes for an incredible record. Like damn y'all,
                                this is some beautiful and crisp Deep House.</p>

                            <p>In terms of why I picked this particular album to write on, I'd say the answer is
                                two-fold. First, I've already extensively written on Chat Pile's *God's Country* on this
                                very site (check it out!). Secondly and most important, this record just hits it out of
                                the park in ways no other did this year. From the initial moment I heard the prelude I
                                was hooked. I am continually stunned by the depth presented in concept, abstract, and
                                execution. There is nothing like this, just enjoy the Deep House ride into the depths.
