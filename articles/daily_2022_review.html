                                My album, or rather albums of the year (because I am cheating), are A, A2, A3, A4, A5,
                                A6(Ethereal Version), A7 and A8. The reason I am reviewing this as one thing, is because
                                as it stands right now, A5 till 8 no longer exist. Alorangel (aka Lora Hunter,
                                Alorangela, Alorangelica, Alarangel, and some more variations) has this odd method of
                                'abusing the algorithm' by continuously reuploading songs and albums, moving stuff
                                around, releasing 'Hard' versions, remixing a song 26(!) times in a row, etc etc.
                                Lora Hunter is definitely more exciting as an idea rather than an artist, but that is a
                                rabbit hole you have to fall down into yourself.</p>

                            <p><a href="https://healthyceleb.com/alorangel/">Alorangel</a></p>

                            <p>So what am I reviewing exactly? It is a collection of around 250 songs, initially
                                released between Jan 11 and Feb 7. Those 250 songs are mutations of around 20 original
                                vocal stems, all warped, fucked and mutated through generational inbreeding and
                                self-remixing.</p>
                            <p>
                                Some of these songs can be traced back all the way to Lora Hunters debut 2016 Album
                                'Make This Day Come Alive'. The title track on that album appears in many different
                                shapes and forms here, as:
                                Experimental outsider rock Make This Day Come Alive (Hard Version).

                            <p>
                                I am currently hard at work trying to catalogue and preserve all these versions and lost
                                albums, but it's extremely difficult considering the pace Lora uploads and removes
                                these.</p>

                            <p>By now you are probably wondering: Why? Why on earth are you listening to this? What
                                makes Alorangel better than that latest Gerogerigegege, the gorgeous Bill Orcutt album,
                                or even the insanely tight Flowers Corsano duo release?
                                Well, all of those are incredible in their own way, but what Lora achieved here feels
                                like an actual Ego Death, to be experienced while listening. It breaks your brain. Turns
                                you into goo. A little snot slut as will. Its impossible to explain what is so good
                                about this, what truly makes this godlike, without just listening to the whole thing.
                                You won't find the same 8 albums I listened to, but just scour around. There is more on
                                youtube than you think. Do some digging. Immersive yourself. Become one with the Lora.
                                Breathe Lora. Make your day come alive.</p>

                                Unfortunately, I'm not too familiar with Hankil's work outside of this so one of the fun
                                parts of EAI aside from the sounds being heard is lost on me. Regardless of not knowing
                                how any of this was created, ③ is still a really gripping listen that demands attention.
                                Hankil creates some of the most animated electronic fuckery I've heard in a bit, sounds
                                retch, pull and contort in so many ways it feels they too are being tortured along with
                                the listener. The discomfort is really heightened by the pacing and structure which
                                while being simple is effective. All ③_ritual does is just have a few minutes where
                                everything has some space to it, before jumping into a nonstop barrage of as much shit
                                as possible leaving you feeling claustrophobic and begging to return to its more docile
                                state. Even when it calms down overall in the second track it's still frantic, and the
                                seemingly submerged filter applied to it fits given the title (③_summons). A different
                                anxiety is tapped into on ③_summons, one of a lurking presence that still feels
                                threatening and ominous. Overall, ③ is incredibly intense and creative. Easily the
                                coolest thing I've heard this year.

                            <p>Under the The Soft Pink Truth moniker, Drew Daniel has creatively subverted dance music
                                expectations by tackling very interesting and sometimes contradictory concepts. Each of
                                his LPs asks a question in it's namesake. For example, taking a super minimalistic
                                electroclash approach to Hardcore/Anarcho Punk staples on 2004's <em>Do You Want New
                                    Wave
                                    or Do You Want The Soft Pink Truth?</em>. On 2022's <em>Is It Going
                                    to Get Any Deeper Than This?</em>, The Soft Pink Truth has come upon probably the
                                most
                                interesting of these prompts. I love the story behind this question: it being directed
                                at Daniel and a friend from someone visiting their DJ set. The core idea of <em>Deeper
                                    Than
                                    This?</em> is the of idea of trying to answer the question in a variety of musical
                                forms,
                                all centered around <em>deepness</em>.</p>

                            <p>From beginning to end, this dwelling on deepness is the primary musical backdrop --
                                extremely pure and moody dance tracks through and through. It may seem like redundant
                                praise, but I do really enjoy how many aspects of this record tackle "deepness". There
                                is depth in the amount of styles "deepified", not just staying in the traditional Deep
                                House lane. Many styles are incorporated into the depths, embracing Dance music with
                                layered, intricate, and moody production. On "La Joie Devant La Mort" there is deep
                                French Pop set into an glamorous Nu-Disco track. "Sunwash" is probably the deepest of
                                the bunch, swirling synths and creeping production changes make for a hypnotic ambient
                                Deep House experience.</p>

                            <p>I could go into much more depth on this given a different written format, but at the end
                                of the day I think the most important question to answer is in the album title. I'd say
                                it does get deeper than <em>this</em>, however Dance music in general can only go so
                                deep. In
                                fact I'd say the mission of this record was an amazing success. It's mission isn't to
                                prove how deep one could go, but is instead a creative retort to a strange question. The
                                layers of deepness, from the question itself to how the concept of deepeness is applied
                                to the music in many fascinating ways makes for an incredible record. Like damn y'all,
                                this is some beautiful and crisp Deep House.</p>

                            <p>In terms of why I picked this particular album to write on, I'd say the answer is
                                two-fold. <a href="../reviews/gods_country.html">First, I've already extensively written
                                    on Chat Pile's <em>God's Country</em> on thivery site.</a>. Secondly and most
                                important, this record just hits it out of
                                the park in ways no other did this year. From the initial moment I heard the prelude I
                                was hooked. I am continually stunned by the depth presented in concept, abstract, and
                                execution. There is nothing like this, just enjoy the Deep House ride into the depths.

                                absolutes, for better or worse. as for the actual sound, all i could assume was that i
                                was to be treated to the tryhardiest cock-rocker black'n'roll ever brought to life by

                                the truth.</p>

                                from the opening notes, it is patently obvious that this album - made entirely in the
                                united states of america - carries the torch of the tried and tested tradition of
                                "triumphant black metal", a singularly upbeat sub-subgenre within the broader
                                post-second wave black metal landscape developed and showcased almost exclusively by
                                european bands. while the earliest traces of what would eventually become triumphant
                                black metal were already apparent in the mid-90s work of certain raw black metal
                                stalwarts like moonblood, it became its own uniquely identifiable strain of black metal
                                in late 90s france where certain - ideologically troublesome but creatively peaking -
                                bands such as seigneur voland or kristallnacht. later down the line, the sound found its
                                true footing in finland where an entire generation of bands - horna, behexen, sargeist
                                and more - borrowed liberally from the wellspring of influences.

                                black metal album. </p>

                                The blurb on the bandcamp page gives all the deets ya need to enjoy the experience. And
                                if you still need selling after things like: “compositional linguistics”, “precision
                                with language, instrumental technique, and gesture”, and “Robert [sic. Bobo] Ashley”,
                                well you're in the wrong supermarket bub. So some sorta wierdo
                                not-your-grand-daddy's-opera opera seems to be the operative - what gives it the sauce
                                to be the pall-bearer* for 2022?</p>

                            <p>It's sparse and dense all at the same time - the double bass is the only specified
                                instrument, laid ripe for the pickin' on the dining table. And pecked at it is: from
                                curious to ravenous forays into its body, the resulting array of sounds a mélange of
                                haphazard stabs and groans as wells as more sophisticated carvings and wails. The sense
                                of the fragmented and the eclectic dovetails nicely into the thrust of the stories - of
                                escape, of exile, of a 'self' in question. Obviously, Sprechstimme rules the day (didn't
                                you know actually singing is so passe'?) and it works marvelously, forcing our ears to
                                not only reckon with the shape of the stories but also the architecture of the sound. We
                                got multiple voices intersecting, running parallel, responding, and diverging, creating
                                some sort of blood flow within the artery-work of the double-bass. This is exodus
                                invoked materially and spiritually, of wandering and wondering. Wondering and wandering.

                                writing this so I'm starting over and finishing this in exactly 8 minutes. Anyway here
                                we go:</p>
                            <p>
                                God Save The ANimals is a good album. It generally continues the country tinge of Rocket
                                and the electronic experiments from Heart of Sugar but merges them into one whole.
                                Runner is the clear highlight of the album. Just a straight up incredible pure choon.
                                WHile other songs might have that ONE special moment, this song is like completely made
                                up of them! From the first piano chord that comes in, to the "they hit your with the
                                rolled up magazine" and the escalating scream when he repeats "yeah i have done a couple
                                bad things".</p>
                            <p>
                                On No Bitterness and Immunity he brings in the hyerpop influence. Miracles is just an
                                excellent an beautiful folk tune with maybe his most personal and heartfelt lyrics yet,
                                considering he just had a baby in real life. While the autotune on Cross the Sea is a
                                bit offputting on a first listen, it really grows on you. The vocal texture on this song
                                is actually unlike anything I've heard. And lastly I love the way the closing song
                                slowly fades in, the same way that the closer of his Beach Music album Snot does.
                                While the album is maybe not groundbreaking, it's just that one album I've put on the
                                most throughout the year and I have not grown tired of it. Can't wait to see what he
                                does next fr fr.
