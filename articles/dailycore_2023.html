            <em>The folks at /daily/ have decided to commune and draw up the specifications for a musical canon that
                will provide the framework for “taste.” The results: something more carnival than cannon. This isn't a
                project borne of consensus, but of doing the dance along tangential circles. We take no credit if you
                snarl “blasphemy!” or sing “hallelujah” - there's only hell for those who aren't ready to boogie on down
                in the big top.

                Over the course of following weeks, we will drip feed in batches of five (unordered) the albums that
                consist the chart, paired with serious and/or whimsical writings for your reading (dis)pleasure. So put
                on your dancing boots and light the fuse - yee-haw!</em>

                                The pallor of death hangs about on the oblique, but not without a little sense of
                                wonder, of adventure - of love. Well, ain't it great that Caroline's got Susie by her
                                side in this grand ol' journey? Brave and inquisitive is Caroline; patient and
                                understanding is Susie: we can't help but be enthralled by the drumming of their hearts.

                                us. Tremulous in this psychedelic state, our thoughts turn to love. Why are there so
                                many love songs? Goddamn Caroline, I don't know - that's the way it is, the way I guess.
                                A way to another place, via the ringing of a steelpan or the wistful singing of a
                                chanteuse or something else. A way somewhere else.

                                Lift To Experience is an obscure shoegaze band from Texas that only released one album
                                of full material, but what an album. The Texas-Jerusalem Crossroads is an ambitious
                                concept album about the Christian apocalypse destroying the habitable world outside of
                                Texas. The story goes that three good ol' boys from Denton Texas are visited by an angel
                                who asks them to lead people to Texas through the power of righteous rock music so that
                                God can establish the Second Jerusalem (there's a humdinger of a line that became a
                                meme: “The USA is the center of JerUSAlem”, atrocious stuff, I love it), there's a bit
                                of a crises of faith and the obligatory doubt, before the band ultimately accepts their
                                roles as the new prophets shortly before the ambiguous “storm” at the end of the album.
                            <p>
                            </p>
                            So, it's a Christian rock album. You might dismiss it out of hand based on this fact
                            alone - modern Christian popular music too often evangelizes in a really gross colonial
                            way or else is infected with cocksure American exceptionalism. And, to be fair, the band
                            is pretty earnest with this stuff. This album was pre-September 11th, and so lyrics like
                            “When America falls the world will fall with her” are received differently now than they
                            were on release. So much of this album presages a reckoning for America, it is hard not
                            to simultaneously see it in the shadow of 9/11 and also read into it deep disaffection
                            for the state of the world during America's victory lap following the fall of the Soviet
                            bloc.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At this stage, I briefly want to touch on the album cover, as most reviewers for this
                                album seem unable to resist commenting on it. It looks “bad” (set aside for a moment
                                that the cover is an homage to classic deep-south hip-hop covers that have an equally
                                ridiculous aesthetic of visual noise). On the face of it, Lift to Experience is a deeply
                                unattractive prospect for a listening experience, that so many people are disarmed by
                                it, and what's more, grow to have a love for this album should tell you something.

                                On July 25th, 2001, all space outside the confines of Aketa No Mise, a jazz club near
                                Tokyo's Nishi-Ogikubo station, ceased to exist for roughly an hour. Most people didn't
                                notice, but those who did would relentlessly pursue any opportunity to revisit the world
                                they had briefly glimpsed then.
                            </p>

                                Fittingly, this record is intimately connected with Aketa No Mise: not only did the
                                venue's owner and namesake Shoji Aketagawa participate in the performance and release
                                the recording on his label Aketa Discs, the ocarina he used to bridge the gaps between
                                piano numbers was also manufactured at the ocarina workshop adjunct to the club, which
                                is also depicted on the album cover.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Beyond the ebb and flow of Aketa's piano veering from gently sensual - some would say
                                erotic - waltz melodies to dissonant free jazz freakouts conjuring veritable
                                thunderstorms on the stage (not to forget his folkloric ocarina themes lending the
                                pieces a touch of the shamanic), the wholly improvised performance features the
                                impassioned - at times seemingly possessed - crooning and sparse enka-inspired guitar of
                                psychedelic blues-folk maestro Kan Mikami, while the drumming of Toshiaki Ishizuka
                                provides a stable foundation, his fills expertly matching the energy of his
                                collaborators.
                            </p>

                                Somehow, even the recording seems to retain some of the performance's ability to shrink
                                the world to the size of a room between the confident reverberation of the very first
                                guitar notes and the ferocity of the final duel between piano and drums. The crowd
                                applauds and geometry unfolds once again.

                                Arthur Russell, together with the engineer Eric Liljestrand, spent countless nights in
                                the 80s locked in a studio to work on the material that would become the album “World of
                                Echo”. And build a world of echo he did. The album consists almost purely of Arthur's
                                singing and cello playing, but is also drenched so wetly in effects that it sounds both
                                incredibly intimate and enormous in size. While Arthur's unusual voice and the loose
                                structure of the album may cause some listeners to bounce off the album quickly, it will
                                reward multiple listens as it slowly unravels its complexity and gorgeous songwriting.
                                Arthur was notoriously unsatisfied with his own work, with the majority of it being
                                released as archival compilations by the label Audika Records, and many songs on the
                                album exist in many different forms. 'Hiding Your Present From You' and 'Let's Go
                                Swimming' for example reappeared on the 2015 compilation 'Corn' in a garage-disco
                                rendition. 'Tower of Meaning / Rabbit's Ear / Home Away From Home ' calls back to one of
                                his few modern classical compositions. 'Treehouse' also exists as a bubbly and fun disco
                                version mixed by Walter Gibbons. Arthur's discography shows that a just plain good song
                                will sound good in all possible forms it's presented in.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even now, more than 30 years after the release of World of Echo, its story hasn't ended.
                                Just this year in 2023, Audika has released 'Picture of Bunny Rabbit', a collection of
                                songs from the World of Echo sessions that sound just as wonderful and worthy of a
                                release as the original project. And on the 2020 release of one of Arthur's live
                                performances, 'Sketches for World of Echo: June 25 1984 Live at Ei', we can discover the
                                full 20-minute long version of the edited down album version of 'Let's Go Swimming'.
                                And who knows what else Arthur still has in store for us… 30 years after his passing?

                        <div id="content">
                            <p>It's easy to make the assumption that Ground Zero doesn't only sample Heiner Goebbles'
                                swagged out jazz work, but also takes his whole style and just adds guitars to it.
                                If you are not fucking stupid, it becomes quite clear that they do so much more.
                            </p>
                            <p> Pekinese Opera's beauty lies in, well, its beauty. It is able to contrast the ominous
                                tension filled layers of toots and howls with these bombastic communist marches (even
                                more noticeable on the live performances). Perhaps a commentary of sorts, but all I (and
                                so should you) care about is this odd serenity that appears from two objectively chaotic
                                extremes.</p>

                            <p>And 'extremes' can be taken quite lightly here. This whole thing is so goddamn
                                digestible and accessible. Like yea,this won't get any radio play any time soon, but
                                Opera hits every checkbox of the avant teen tourist.
                                It's just pretentious enough with its samples, has its lead member involved in that one
                                meme EAI album, and started off by playing fucking John Zorn.
                                It's all there for the tourist - a quirky aesthetic and obtuse cover, ripe to be plucked
                                and placed at the top of their topsters chart.</p>

                            <p>And this whole thing has me thinking. Why isn't this the case? With the explosive rise
                                of Tiktok, Ground Zero is a time bomb ready to bust on a new generation of horrid
                                avant-teens. Is Revolutionary Pekinese Opera soon to be the anthem of this new
                                generation? If you have Billie Eilish, one of the biggest pop stars in the world,
                                sporting a Blod Besvimelse shirt, how far away are we really from a Ground Zero standom?
                                Is this a bad thing? The aforementioned John '100 gecs for boomers' Zorn only holds a
                                foul taste in my mouth due to the numerous dogshit clownmusic bands his influence
                                spawned into existence. But as Schopenhauer - was it Schopenhauer? Yes, I believe so -
                                anyway, Schopenhauer once said that "All truth passes through three stages. First, it is
                                ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being
                                self-evident."</p>

                            <p>
                                Anyway, I really don't know, and I don't know if I even care. The album is fucking
                                great, and at the end of the day, what even is a review other than saying 'I like it
                                because it sounds nice'. All of Pekinese Opera's elements are a recipe for a quirked up
                                obnoxious disaster, but somehow they made it work.
                                It sounds nice!
