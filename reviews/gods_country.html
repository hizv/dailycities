        <p>On July 22nd, 2022 the up-and-coming Oklahoma City Sludge Metal group Chat Pile released their debut LP
            entitled <em>God's Country</em>.</p>
        <p><em><strong>CW: Suicide</strong></em></p>

        <p>This group has been making a lot of noise since their fantastic entrance to the wider music sphere with
            twin 2019 EPs, This Dungeon Earth and Remove Your Skin Please. While I love their tar-thick sound and
            body-shaking riffs, it was the subject matter and its delivery that really stood out to me. It's a very
            raw and real take on specific life experiences and overall ills that plague many in this country.
            Specifically, this middle column of the US that both me and the group call home. While many of these
            experiences are shared by many in this country, I've found that you can see a very unfiltered America
            here. It's no coincidence that many states in this part of the country rank very high on the list of
            worst places to live. From healthcare to violence to economic opportunity, it's a pretty dismal sight
            over the vast amount of land that these places hold. In particular, it's the places that have been left
            to their own devices, whether through means of abandonment by the corporations and industries that once
            propped them up, or general degradation of public services, there is a mass swath of dehumanization and
            pain here. What I've found with the music that Chat Pile makes is that it embodies the pain of
            inequality and destitution that have been getting worse for years. When a band can combine very
            meaningful and impactful concepts with incredible music, the resulting piece can have reverberations
            across the scene.</p>

        <p>Now, I don't blame Chat Pile for waiting so long to bring together this project. I had heard whispers
            that they had been planning on this for a while, but obviously the initial brunt of the COVID-19
            pandemic shook everyone up. It comes as no surprise that fulfilling this full length debut after being
            thrown this curveball could lend for some more time for polish. It's a testament to Chat Pile that those
            incredible EPs were able to birth and maintain such high expectations three years out. There is a flip
            side to that though; a failure to maintain momentum or perhaps even losing vision. Of course, the record
            is out now and I've listened to it an ungodly amount of times, almost punitively. I'm in awe of it, in
            disgust of it, entirely engaged by it. It's the kind of record that only comes around once in a
            lifetime, both for the music itself and the level of personal connection I was able to get out of it.
            <em>God's Country</em> is a definitive record for the times we live in. It's a heavy masterpiece that grinds
            down
            to the core of middle American identity but also for the individual experiences our culture has forced
            onto us.
        </p>

        <p>This debut record covers a surprising amount of ground in its 40 minute runtime, both in the sense of
            lyrical themes and the progression of their sound since the first EPs. While they still follow in the
            same footsteps of previous output, the group has added a lot to their toolbox. Take the lead single and
            opener of the record, "Slaughterhouse". They are no stranger to putting a brutal and great hook to
            dismal music and this is no exception as the dissonant lead guitar scrapes over the grinding chorus of
            "hammers and grease". Defined by themes of desperately hoping for a way to break free from a terrible
            place where "God is always watching" and "all heads ring...", the track dispenses a palpable sense of
            despair. While this feeling is undoubtedly lent to by the dissonant and rhythmic instrumental backing,
            it's the vocalist, Raygun Busch, that makes it a reality. Busch is absolutely beside himself with both
            the more spoken word passages as to the growled and yelled vocals. He projects a vision of someone
            battling internal demons, which based on later songs on the tracklist is not a far-fetched assumption.
            Something done in both respects on the next track and single released after "Slaughterhouse", "Why".
            This track has not only great thick riffs but also one of the best straight talks about the injustices
            in our country. I think the outro, led on by air raid sirens and a stellar riff change, put it
            optimally:

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Horror story<br>
                Real American horror story<br>
                And it's a fuckin' tragedy<br>
                Fuckin' tragedy<br>
                Every day<br>
                Every day<br>
                People have to live outside<br>
                Why?<br>
            </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I really need to sell the delivery here, because he shows the feeling of being so lost for words that
            a solvable problem is being ignored, that we ask "why?". This sense of anger and disillusionment is
            a major theme of <em>God's Country</em>, and I really appreciate how everything comes together to show
            that.
            The next track "Pamela", focuses on a much more personal tragedy. The song describes the apparent
            drowning of a kid and the self-destructive nature that takes hold of the narrator under the
            resulting grief. This depressing song describes the feeling of wanting to turn back time to
            alleviate the self-blame of events outside our control. The mental demons march during the chorus of
            "waiting to die" with a disgusting guitar melody on top of it. While dwelling on tragedy is the
            focal point, another theme I find in this continuing throughout the record is revenge. Revenge
            against those who have done wrong, even the self.</p>

        <p>Anger exudes from this record for the life that many live in our country's backwaters. "Wicked Puppet
            Dance" describes an interaction with a meth dealer and their acquaintance in their house. A really
            disturbing scene unfolds, with cockroaches being birthed in the walls and the dealer's skin being
            fucked up. The track's fast-paced and chaotic instrumentation lends itself to the prescribed
            sensation of IV meth. A small touch I really love on this track is the little rest before the second
            uttering of "a wicked puppet". I got goosebumps from how it increases the tension and drops into the
            second half of the song. The next track "Anywhere" is my favorite track. This track is about being
            present during a shooting scenario, describing the grim details of worlds being shattered as bodily
            fluids are expelled on the speaker. Again, the feeling of desperation and despair is exuded as their
            reality catches up to the situation at hand. I love the soaring guitar during chorus and the switch
            to the dark bass forward post-chorus. It is a great way to break away from the group's bass-leaning
            style. This is funnily their lightest sounding track considering the subject-matter, but I think
            again this can be attributed to these songwriting switchups. In a weird way it is a very Grunge
            influenced kind of track. Outside of some of the heaviness present, this wouldn't be too out of
            place of Alice in Chains' catalog.</p>

        <p>From here, we lie on the firm back half of this LP. With four songs it actually comes with a nice
            clean divide. First up is "Tropical Beaches, Inc." and "The Mask". The former, "Tropical Beaches, Inc"
            is a play on the inability for most to attain the economic opportunities found through the internet
            or TV by grifters. I really appreciated the subtle ocean aspect put into the songs. Both in the
            light surf instrumentation in the verses and the metaphor of economic opportunity being literally on
            some beach across the ocean, very far away from this landlocked part of the country. The next track,
            "The Mask", is really ugly, in a good way. I think the state of mind that best describe it is
            "absolutely demented". This description of a robbery from the perspective of a tweaked out
            individual is complemented perfectly by Raygun's delivery. The added effects of sniffling and
            spitting that is picked up on the mic really sells how unstable this situation is. I love the sludgy
            power chord riff onslaught during the chorus. While I like both “Tropical Beaches, Inc” and “The
            Mask” quite a lot, it's a hard task to stand out from what comes next.</p>

        <p>The last two tracks are an odd pair. They are both super dark but about very different things,
            utilizing completely different instrumentation, and with very mismatched length. Where the former
            lies at just under 3 minutes and the latter is a 9 minute behemoth. This former track, "I Don't Care
            If I Burn" is much more of a dark tune accompanied by low presence kick drum and all manner of
            scrapes, crunches, and other assortments of sounds. I don't think I've heard a song so hell-bent on
            destruction that has such a low profile. That's outside the screaming at the end of course, which
            caught me off guard for sure. "Just looking for some peace" Raygun continually says as the track
            ends, a real hope to close out some very terrible happenings in his life. This dark personal hatred
            is something you get from a lot of Chat Pile's catalog.I think that this track, even though not one
            you'll put on the aux in the car, serves a really great purpose on the album. It sets up that
            thought, "Just looking for some peace". That's where the revenge comes from, it's where the
            overarching and existential problems drill into your brain. We're not built to be stressed 24/7, we
            reach a breaking point. Unfortunately that breaking point can lead to some very bad decisions,
            killing the people that have done you wrong being among them. The final track though, is the
            embodiment of the final worst decision you can make.</p>

        <p>To say "grimace_smoking_weed.jpeg" is a track about suicide would be an understatment. It's an odd
            thing to say given the title at first glance. Hell, even when I saw the tracklist for the first time
            I thought I was gonna get some really clever songs along the lines of "Mystery Meat". As the album
            progressed, it was becoming clear how odd of a thematic switch that would be for a closer. I was
            very right in that sense. To quickly describe the throws of this track, it is essentially describing
            all the phases of suicide. Very vividly in fact. Stuff that I've been through, many have been
            through. The visualization of that picture of "purple man smoking weed in my bedroom" taking over
            the mind of the Raygun until that picture embodies who he wants to be. "I am purple man, too",
            Raygun says as the picture becomes quite clear that this image is not of the McDonalds mascot but of
            a fantasy of his dead self. As the track goes on, so too do the phases of grief. The vivid
            culmination of this psychotic breakdown as this final decision bears on his soul will stick with me
            forever. This whole track is scraping a raw nerve of undoing oneself. Even when the attempt is found
            out by a family member, he is beside himself. He's not happy he was saved, he is sad that he got
            found. That he couldn't end it on his terms, only to have to further scar those who love him. It's a
            heartbreaking track, one of the most affecting songs I've ever listened to. The instrumentation is
            orchestrated so well to pair with such themes. With bass-led heavy riffs and feedback drones,
            Raygun's stressed delivery becomes a visualization of a downward mental spiral. At the end of the
            day, it's a masterpiece.</p>

        <p><em>God's Country</em> embodies so much of the ills of our society. The pain that we as a collective feel
            under the watchful eye and hold of capitalism. The inability for our government, even ourselves, to
            properly regulate and to fix issues that are plainly solvable. The enduring culture of individualism
            that plagues our souls, leading to not only an inability to help or get help from others but to also
            go in headfirst to the system. It all sums up everything so perfectly and not in a preachy way; it's
            a raw and real take. This record really has been sticking with me. I feel I've barely touched on the
            instrumentation but it's hard to describe how perfect their toolbox is. The songs are varied but
            they are all still extremely Chat Pile. That thick bass combined with the common transitions of
            grungy distorted rhythm guitar to dissonant soaring lead is a really cool feat. The drums are
            killer, not super technical by any means but do their job well with how big and pounding they are. I
            guess it's sort of what drums do but their power here really holds a leadership position. The
            rhythmic and sludgy instrumentation is essential to the group's addictive sound, but the key to all
            of this are the vocals. It might turn some people off with how much he embraces the anti-vocalist
            approach, but the way he can project hurt through his intonation is unmatched. I'm not saying that
            other Sludge Metal acts don't wear their emotion on their sleeves, it's just that Chat Pile was able
            to tap into a much darker and more raw psyche. Their whole image comes off much more sincere and
            that made this record really stick in my mind. With that all being said, it's hard to come out the
            other side of this record without saying it's phenomenal. A near perfect package. I loved everything
            on here, granted not all the same level but I can't think of any real criticisms. Chat Pile have now
            firmly defined their sound and planted their flag in the music landscape with <em>God's Country</em>. If
            there is literally one full LP that you listen to this year, I highly recommend this record. It's
            heavy and chaotic music for sure but it doesn't dare fall into tropes or half-commit to its
            messages. It's one of the most real records I've ever listened to.</p>
