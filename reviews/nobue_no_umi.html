        <p>Haunting yet sweet, a melancholic lightheartedness
            floats amongst the notes. <i>Nobue no Umi</i> (Nobue’s Sea)
            was originally released in 1975, privately pressed and,
            unfortunately, an already posthumous offering by that time.
            Nobue Kawana succumbed to cancer on her 19th birthday, in
            1974, with the ‘75 LP pressing created in memoriam of her,
            a frail yet buoyant girl. The pressing was distributed only
            to close friends of Kawana, a hidden celebration of life
            circulating isolated waters. Until 2013, when Branco Label
            put out a CD reissue, adorned with two bonus tracks,
            finally allowing this gem to be enjoyed by the greater public.</p>
        <img src="/reviews/files/album_covers/nobue_no_umi_back.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: auto;">
        <p>In a soft folk rock style with bossa nova stylings (and
            some psych-ier touches here and there), the songs careen
            towards the listener. Narrations about the sea, sickness,
            and high school interject here and there (based on my
            rudimentary understanding of Japanese). A warm recording
            hiss wraps around each track lovingly - a snapshot of a
            beachside girl ensconced in her present rises up from and
            reflects against the waves.</p>
        <p>Dated and dusty the image might seem, but that’s the
            charm: clear and striking eyes unearth themselves from the
            caked photograph, demanding us to look back. Kawana’s voice
            is stunning, able to cradle itself as in <i>Anata to
                Hajimete Atta Umi</i> (tr. "The Sea When I First Met You" -
            studio recording) or cut a mature shape as in the backing
            music for the narrations.</p>
        <p>Of course, the sea cannot be forgotten - it features not
            only lyrically, but also aurally. The waves crash shoreward
            throughout the album, meeting and melding with the hiss.
            Kawana is constantly in conversation with the sea, catching
            it’s wind and scent in gentle guitar plucks, in delicate
            piano chords, in earnest crooning. It all ebbs and flows
            with a certain wistfulness. The image of the sea and sand
            engaging in some dramatized and playful battle - or is it
            romance? - comes to mind. A running to and a running from.
            But that’s neither here nor there. If I had to pick a
            favorite from the album, it would have to be <i>"Kaigara no
                Omoide"</i> ("Memory of a Seashell") — the vocal duet
            criss-crossing in and out of synchronization and the
            astringent guitar tone (which has a
            dryness/hardness/bitterness about it) pair well to offer a
            wonderfully textured and earnest ditty.</p>

        <p>Undoubtedly, Kawana was not alone in this work
            (although, unfortunately, I haven’t found a comprehensive
            credits list for the album). An integral part of the
            recording, and who I believe played a role in its
            re-release, is Keiko Saitou. A childhood friend of Kawana,
            she provided backing vocals and piano on the album, as well
            as helped with the lyrics. The male vocalist who performs
            some of the narrations on the album turns out to be a
            mutual friend of the two girls, enlisted by Saitou post the
            passing of Kawana to give light to her friend’s life as she
            pushed fervently to collate the tracks and press the
            album.</p>
        <p>With the 2013 re-release, Saitou spoke at length about
            her relationship with Kawana (a translation of which can be
            seen in the comments <a
                href="https://www.discogs.com/%E6%B2%B3%E5%90%8D%E4%BC%B8%E6%B1%9F-%E3%81%AE%E3%81%B6%E3%81%88%E3%81%AE%E6%B5%B7/release/14075773">
                here</a>). A friendship blossomed between the two at age
            16, even though it was met with the disapproval of Saitou’s
            parents (who were more concerned with her performing well
            academically). She mentions Kawana’s virtuosic talent -
            perfect pitch and the ability to pick up and play most any
            instrument. But more importantly, she speaks of the
            positivity Kawana approached life in spite of her
            deteriorating health. In those youthful days, Saitou would
            often scamper off to play and make music with Kawana,
            despite her parents always chiding her to study more
            instead. Their feverish passion shines through even after
            all these years - for that, I am immensely grateful.</p>
        <h2>Author's Note</h2>
        <p>I want to thank Noka (Youtube channel owner/user) for
            putting up a rip - I would have never found this work
            otherwise. And as well to Youtube user Jeff Clayton for
            providing some further details about the work as well as
            the link to Saitou’s blog in the comments of that video.
            It’s always a joy to see impassioned music fans unearth and
            share their loves - the spirit of “crate digging” is alive
            and well!</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, yet understandably, that video has since
            been removed at the behest of Branco Label. Small outfits
            that take on these passion projects of, more often than
            not, miniscule, if existent, profit margins deserve to have
            their efforts protected (and lauded). If you are so moved,
            you can buy the CD from their <a href="http://brancolabel.web.fc2.com/">site</a> - and they have
            options available for international shipping!</p>
        <p>Here’s a <a href="http://www.forum-bon.co.jp/myself_jiyugaoka/2013/01/post_499.html">
                link</a> to Saitou’s blog post, which I thankfully saved at
            the time I saw it. The page is now defunct, but can still
            be accessed via the Wayback Machine for what it’s worth.
            Google translate gives an idea of what she said, though I’m
            sure it's not exact - any proficient speakers/readers
            please let me know if I have misrepresented anything!</p>
