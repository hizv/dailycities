        <p>Arsedestroyer had been going further each release, further into melted strips of iron, bringing your skin
            back with them after a quick touch, your body bubbling and smoking right before your eyes. 56E2533 It's the
            delay pedal that truly makes this. Through churning flows of guitar feedback, ride cymbal being torn to
            shreds, vocal chords turning to rubble, the delay pedal to the side mocks piercing feedback with petulance,
            swinging it up and down, rolling its fingers along your eardrums, picking at them with its grimy nails,
            giving little pinches. Arsedetroyer's end-of-the-line, if Discogs and RYM can be trusted, band member's
            asshole forever stretched and puckering on Last.FM bas relief for band's memorial. 3EF04A5 The noise
            elements have been ushered up to the fore, the foremost so far, riffs discernable with care but not needed,
            only the sounds of horror, sound waves ripping loops through guitar, microphone, and amplifier and into
            recording device. Grit on concrete floor, broken pelvis has driven into my palm now, no
            blood but fresh blooming pain, no matter, bruised hip bleeds fine, internally, spreading as the skin pools
            and buckles outwards to match the liquid's flow.</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">what does this do?</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Shattering the bones then moving his limbs about rapidly to displace
            further and interrupt any chance of the bones setting and fusing
            again. His bones are going to be like shrapnel from an explosion,
            just shards of bone everywhere in his arms.
            holy fuck did he steal or something?
            No, this prison is overcrowded and they torture new prisoneres
            because everyone of them means even less space for the rest. This
            dude might not have something terrible at all to get jailed, maybe
            just stole something.
            Where'd you get this info? How does ruining his arms create more
            space in jail? In reality he's most likely a pickpocket, and they
            destroy his arms to stop him from doing it in the future.
            Read it somewhere, not sure if it was bestgore or whereever. Google
            "Brasil prison arms jeffyfied" and you surely find some info, it's
            pretty common in those hell holes.
            It obviously doesn't create more space (unless they die), it's just a
            punishment.</p>
        <p style="font-size: small; font-style: italic; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I’ve
            transformed into a pig.
            Got a belly and a leg that is way up my spine. P.
            wants to see my penis. I'm masturbating in this building. Now, if we want to see my dick, we have to get to
            the bathroom. Make a wish and get us there quickly. Just push the wooden tube we entered. Oh, gaily. Tearing
            my arms around me, I feel only the heat of the plastic door. J. tells me to get back. Back turned, mew my
            tum, come get me some hot water, and get to the bathroom, and shake my hand. Otherwise, ants will come in to
            get me. Make a wish, anal access would take about a minute. Otherwise, hot water, sweating, sacks and sacks
            would've pulped my body. Driving past a red stretch of abandoned old wooden spandex blocks, old wooden
            barrier. Man sits on wooden stepstools, foot cream and I onto gravel. Alcohol makes my body itch and he
            drops a pillow onto my stomach. I'm masturbating in his face. Father, make a wish and I’ll be a librarian.
            He orders my son a favor, walks in with a friend, and I am looking sternly at porn. He has me swelled with
            abandon. Father, get to see my son. I'll make a wish and get me to the bathroom.</p>
        <p>GBN's guitars are obviously much more legible than Arsedestroyer's, initially causing my
            listening to lean back on its haunch, this stance pummeled soon enough by velcro blastbeats and
            locust noise accoutrements. D74E137 With this ability gained, hallways were traversed freely
            and at will. And it came to pass that I spilled my seed unto all four corners of that establishment.
            And each crack and crevice therein came to be tumescent with my seed. And I spent much time
            thusly, sowing the hallways and rooms of the establishment, nary slowing my pace. And so I
            came to find my skin growing taught, then, after a time, sagging. And I came to realize I had
            spent 80 years in this state (12 yo w/ wrinkles and liver spots); and I found that I had been
            observed the whole of my time in that establishment by a certain S. DCAA971 GBN being a much
            cuter band than one would expect, frequently sampling from John Waters movies despite the
            harlequin babies and suchlike they plaster across their album covers. An aside: the
            nimb-techniques on display here—forming a continuous black mass, pullulating with
            appendages of hypodermic aluminum filaments—should be noted. Being discovered by S., I was
            at once strapped to a gibbet and strung up off the floor; and being in this state, ere I could
            mouth a word of protest, I was thereupon injected with vaporous chemicals of sundry species
            and genera, I know not which. E818862 And I must confess that the liquids contained in those
            cursed phials must have either placed me in a somnambulistic state or wiped the events to come
            from my memory, for I wot not a single effect induced by these chemicals, save the creation of a
            gap in memory spanning from the time of injection to my sudden return to consciousness some
            days later.</p>

                <p>Twenty-two people were found dead after a car driven by a Miami man
                    entered a wooded area around 6:45 a.m. Sunday, Dec. 11, 2017, in a
                    stairwell. All but one were pronounced dead at the scene. (Kimberly
                    P. Dawson/The Washington Post)</p>
                <p>A roadway was also hit by a large volume of concrete on Sunday
                    afternoon, Dec. 11. No roadway was opened and all life was left
                    standing, said Miami-Dade Fire Rescue. No one was injured. No other
                    life was declared safe.</p>
                <p>A man and a woman walking on I-80 in front of a TV were among about
                    20 people shot and critically wounded at the scene, said Miami-Dade
                    fire marshal Kelli Rowe. No motive was released.</p>
                <p>A woman and four children were inside a Starbucks on I-80 in front of
                    a TV were among about 20 people shot and critically wounded at the
                    scene, said Miami-Dade fire rescue. No motive was released.</p>
                <p>At a news conference, a man and a woman walking on I-80 in front of a
                    TV were among aboited when a glass of glass shattered glass ripped
                    off by a group of people was pelted with rubber bullets. A man and a
                    woman both had been shot dead.</p>
                <p>A second child was inside a Starbucks on I-80 in front of a TV were
                    inside, no other life was declared safe. No furtively piercing glass!
                    glass! (Long Live the Home for the Dreamer).</p>
                <p>A second child was inside a Starbucks on I-80 in front of a TV were
                    inside. No fuming or saying anything, but the fuming felt and the
                    glass melted. Upon closing the house, I heard screams downstairs
                    calling for help. A voice on the wall of the building asking for help
                    is “WATCHED TERRORIST RATFIAGE'S MISSION,” screams another child.
                    Officials responded “no comment” when asked the meaning of this
                    phrase.</p>

        <p>Nikudorei are bar none the most painful punk band out there. More piercing and raw even than
            early Halalnihil and late Masokismi. In Torture Sessions for Noise Feast, they change les
            blockeurs so to speak. DE7E443 The song, with its mocking farts of glitching feedback peeking
            through its sinuous shrieks of pure electricity, not to mention the faux-noir trumpet moping in
            the rear, brings to me a primal memory associated with the feeling of pain: my sister biting
            through the skin of my right arm as we ride a small amusement park ride together, causing
            blood to escape. Another: pulling the bandaging from my torn-up knee where the blood had
            soaked through, forming a sizable scab, connecting my flesh to the cloth.</p>

                <p>Two men were found fatally shot on a popular trail in Mount Rainier National Park.</p>
                <p>Hikers on Saturday stumbled across the bodies of two men at Tolmie Peak Lookout, a 7-1/2-mile hike in
                    the northwest corner of the park. The men, ages 29 and 34, died of apparent self-inflicted gunshot
                    wounds, according to park officials. It is thought the pair committed suicide on Halloween day.</p>
                <p>They have not been identified, and neither are from Western Washington.</p>
                <p>This time of year, Mowich Lake Road is closed for the season and hiking a stretch of the road adds a
                    mile to the hike. It was not immediately known when the men shot themselves, but it was believed to
                    be within a few days before they were discovered. The men were found near each other and close to
                    the lookout, park spokesman Kevin Bacher said.</p>
                <p>Their bodies were flown out of the area Sunday. The Pierce County
                    Medical Examiner’s Office is conducting autopsies.</p>
                <p>They were dressed in Fallout 4 costumes. <img src="/reviews/files/wtf.png"
