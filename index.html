            <h1>What is Daily?</h1>
            <p>
                /daily/ is an online community of friends who share
                a common passion: discovering and listening to new
                music. Kickstarted as the "Daily Album Challenge" on
                July 1st, 2014, by GivingBear, /daily/ has since
                outgrown the original "a new album a day" idea and
                become a place to share music and other artforms. In
                early 2019 the /daily/ Discord Server was founded and
                that is where most of us now communicate with each other.

            <p>
                This website was an old dream of having a community
                blog or website where we could post our articles,
                reviews, and other music-related musings. Through it,
                we hope to spread awareness about lesser-known artists
                and bands we love. Welcome to /daily/, let's find some tunes!
