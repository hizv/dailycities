            </center>
            <p>/daily/ is an online community of friends who share a common passion: Discovering and listening to new
                music.
                Kickstarted as the "Daily Album Challenge" in July 1st, 2014 by GivingBear, Daily has since outgrown
                the original "a new album a day" idea and has since become a place to share music and other artforms.
                In early 2019 the /daily/ Discord Server was founded and that is where most of us now communicate with
                each
                other.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>This website was an old dream of having a community blog or website where we could post our articles,
                reviews
                and other music-related musings. Through it we hope we can spread awareness about lesser-known artists
                and bands we love. Welcome to /daily/, let's find some tunes!</p>
