            <p>
            /daily/ is an online community of friends who share
            a common passion: discovering and listening to new
            music. Kickstarted as the "Daily Album Challenge" on
            July 1st, 2014, by GivingBear, /daily/ has since
            outgrown the original "a new album a day" idea and
            become a place to share music and other artforms. In
            early 2019 the /daily/ Discord Server was founded and
            that is where most of us now communicate with each other.

            This website was an old dream of having a community
            blog or website where we could post our articles,
            reviews, and other music-related musings. Through it,
            we hope to spread awareness about lesser-known artists
            and bands we love. Welcome to /daily/, let's find some tunes!
