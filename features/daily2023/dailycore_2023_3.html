                                Les Rallizes Denudes is a band that exists largely in bootlegs (and now, post the 
                                probable death of frontman and only consistent member, Takahashi Mizutani, in 2019, 
                                “official” reissues on the Temporal Drift imprint). This is because (of course) of 
                                events surrounding the band related to the 1970 hijacking of Japan Airlines Flight 351, 
                                it's subsequent hostage crisis - did you know the Director of Pepsi America and a 
                                future Catholic Cardinal was on that flight - and the further flight to North Korea, 
                                where founding bassist Moriaki Wakabayashi lives to this day (allegedly). Like Mayhem, 
                                it is impossible to talk about this band without mentioning the circumstances of 
                                certain members' felonious actions. This is a shame, as the legend looms large over any 
                                discussion of the music. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                What's there is astounding. Drenched in feedback, analog (meaning fiddly, hard-style) 
                                tape-delay, reverb, and a truly huge-sounding fuzztone (internet says probably a modded 
                                Big Muff), the guitar pyroclastics on this album are a truly impressive achievement 
                                especially considering the live setting and the reclusive nature of the band. A close 
                                friend once said that delay is a bitch of an effect because if you make a mistake, the 
                                audience hears your mistake repeated several times back to them, you really have to 
                                commit to the bit; LRD does it for an hour and a half, an impressive feat of 
                                musicianship. This recording manages to make this sound tender and brutally punishing at 
                                once. Lightyears ahead of its time (perhaps coterminous with bands like The Velvet 
                                Underground and White Noise), Les Rallizes Denudes laid the blueprint for noise and 
                                shoegaze guitarists like J. Mascis and Kevin Shields, whose music I dearly love and 
                                aspire to sound like. Like the legend then, the bands influence is clearly evident.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Kevin Shields once described his sound as like an infinite horizon in a youtube video 
                                floating around the internet. Unlike an actual horizon, like a seascape which has a 
                                limit on what you can perceive due to the curvature of the earth, you can imagine this 
                                horizon of sound infinitely stretching away. The effects on '77 Live achieve this 
                                effect, the feedback and reverb and the bends scratch away at the infinite in a way 
                                that few other musicians could hope to achieve.

                                This album was absolutely OP in Tourneys on the OG threads. I was largely responsible 
                                for recommending it in that setting - it was the absolutely nuclear option. Nigh on a 
                                guaranteed 8+ - can you blame me, who doesn't like winning?

                                It's hard to focus with all the noise around us. Mundane interactions and intrusive 
                                thoughts act as ultimate distractions in our lives. Ever-present in our experience - 
                                this noise. It exists over our spectrum of senses in a way that excites and conceals.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Is this about to happen? What is this I'm hearing, tasting, experiencing?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Ultimately we can't be so certain. But out of the distressing noise, exists melody -- 
                                satisfying songs of life and structure.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                From the album art to the music itself, the melancholic take on life portrayed on 
                                Public Strain has always struck me. Following the melodic through-line with these 
                                songwriting beats is the foamy dissonance that washes over the listener - It's cold, 
                                but provides a path to get through it. I can't think of a better example of this on 
                                the record than the closer, "Eyesore".  The burned vision of those lost appearing at 
                                the most selfishly inconvenient, if apt, moments.  The quarter-note snare drags the 
                                tune along, simplistic beats of time forever. Embracing the moments of lull in a noisy 
                                situation to connect with someone, before the pure image is gone.
                            </p>

                                More than a decade later, this record has struck a chord with time's developments. The 
                                noise seemed to sort of peak in the past few years for a multitude of reasons. If for 
                                anything else, I feel many connect to this record for the almost comforting wash of 
                                noise and drone. It's quite reflective of the noises that occur (e.g. nature on the 
                                walk to the store, weird things your neighbor is doing) while you are trying to focus 
                                on the here and now. Sitting in that light dissonance can weirdly pull you out.
                            </p>

                                In our music circles, Public Strain holds an incredible crown. It is the only modern 
                                Indie Rock record to stand timeless. It exists in its own plane of existence, very 
                                ethereal. But its mood-setting is unmatched, able to pull countless into a genre so 
                                filled with imitators and quick songcraft. At the end of the day, this record feels 
                                very at home as a core record for this community. A stamp in time where many had 
                                recently begun their musical journey.

                                Tago Mago is when Can came into their own as musicians, becoming arguably the biggest 
                                and most critically acclaimed German band of all time (with the exception of maybe 
                                Rammstein). Foundational to the “Krautrock Sound”, Tago Mago is probably the finest 
                                of their trilogy of most-known albums and was enormously influential to the development 
                                of rock music going forward.

                                CAN started after Irmin Schmidt traveled to New York during the late 60s, coming into 
                                close proximity to the minimalist and avant garde artists active at the time (most 
                                importantly, Andy Warhol and likely The Velvet Underground) and became inspired by the 
                                potential of rock music. Prior to this, Schmidt had studied European modern classical 
                                music; his dream for CAN was to combine the European tradition of classical music with 
                                the American traditions of jazz and rock music. On returning to Cologne, Schmidt formed 
                                a core of four dweeb multi-instrumentalists; himself on keys, Michael Karoli on guitar, 
                                Holger Czukay on bass, and Jaki Leibezeit on drums. This squad, alongside a revolving 
                                cast of other misfits, became CAN. Original member Malcolm Moody apparently suggested 
                                the name due to the positive connotations that the word carries in Turkish - only 
                                later did Leibezeit (ironically) suggest that the name meant “Communism, Anarchism, 
                                Nihilism”, after an English magazine erroneously claimed this was the case.

                                Crucial for the sound of this particular album and the two that follow it are the 
                                vocal stylings of Damo Suzuki. After Malcolm Mooney departed the band on the advice 
                                of his psychiatrist (not, as is assumed, as a result of a psychotic breakdown), CAN 
                                were in want of a singer. Suzuki was busking in Munich when he was approached by Czukay 
                                and Leibezeit, who asked if he would join their band for a performance that night. 
                                Suzuki agreed and thereafter was a signature element in CAN's sound. Suzuki, a Japanese 
                                immigrant in Germany, sung in multiple languages and improvised many of his lyrics in 
                                the studio. The effect is rather impressionistic. Suzuki's free associative lyrics are 
                                only strange on paper, however, while listening they seem to be the perfect fit.

                                The eighteen-minute Halleluhwuh closes out the first half of the album, and is 
                                rightfully considered a masterpiece. Leibnezeit and Czukay work so well together as 
                                rhythmic counterparts, they dwell in the pocket.

                                This album is my favourite way to feel bad. Let me explain.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In 2019, following the submission of my honours thesis and graduation from university, 
                                I traveled to “mainland” China to teach English to grade schoolers. I say grade 
                                schoolers, but it was an after school tutor company preying on middle-class people 
                                hoping to give their children a leg up by studying English with native speakers (set 
                                aside that almost none of us expats had teaching experience: even in “so-called” 
                                communist countries, the grindset is real) - all of the content  that we taught was 
                                freely available on the internet. I was part educator, part child-entertaining clown. 
                                No wonder the company eventually folded when the owners pissed off to Macau to gamble 
                                everybody's money at the casinos. My first class was with three-year-olds. I sat (on 
                                the floor) in a classroom of screaming (as in crying) toddlers for over an hour 
                                desperately trying to run exercises on numbers and letters. Nobody in that room spoke 
                                a lick of English other than me and all of the other tutors (including those who also 
                                spoke Mandarin) were busy with their own classes. The manager of the facility 
                                frantically talked to parents and attempted to appease the kids with plush toys 
                                clearly purchased from a vending machine. Afterwards, I hid in the stairwell, 
                                chain-smoking Marlboro reds, and I listened to Duster, wallowing in my own self-pity 
                                with a zeff gangster from the Johannesburg boondocks who had just had a similar 
                                experience.

                                Being a monolingual foreigner is an alienating and infantilising experience. I'm a 
                                ruminating sort of guy, and placed in that situation, I was forced to ruminate harder, 
                                deprived of communication save gestural, languageless encounters like smiling at an 
                                old lady doing her shopping. It's a profound isolation, is the point I'm making. 
                                Throughout my trip, music from bands like Duster, Carissa's Wierd, and Horse Jumper of 
                                Love were the soundtrack to my aimless wanderings through city streets (along with Big 
                                Thief, Alex G, and Chad VanGaalen, but those projects, while I deeply love them, are 
                                slightly offside vibe and sound-wise for this particular review).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For many of us, Duster holds a special place among the music that we used to listen to 
                                during “interesting times”, to use a Chinese proverb Slavoj Zizek is fond of. Like 
                                much of the guitar-music that I listen to (and that is a majority of my taste, I've 
                                discovered), Duster can deliver on the fuzzed-out, shitheel shoegaze sound. One only 
                                need listen to the track “Earth-Moon Transit” off this album, or “Orbitron” from the 
                                Transmission, Flux single or the astounding “Me and the Birds” from the follow-up 
                                Contemporary Movement. However, Duster is perhaps best in a more contemplative, 
                                clean-toned, “spacy”  register with songs like “Inside Out”, “Topical Solution”, or 
                                the masterstroke “Constellations” from this album, or “Cooking” and “Unrecovery” from 
                                Contemporary Movement.

                                A not insignificant portion of the success of this band's sound is the low-fidelity 
                                nature of a lot of the recordings. I believe intentionally so, the lo-fi aesthetic 
                                “dates” the recordings, so tracks like “Gold Dust” or “Stratosphere” hit just right 
                                under sodium light and light sleet. It's evocative of nostalgia in the same way that 
                                Mark Fisher talks about Burial or The Caretaker evoking “lost futures” in his writings 
                                for K-Punk and elsewhere. Duster's Stratosphere encourages rumination on the 
                                potentialities of the past.
